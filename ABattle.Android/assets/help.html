	Abattle is a variant of xbattle (UNIX). It is a concurrent multi-player (LAN/WLAN) battle strategy game.
	<H2 id="menu">Main Screen</h2>
	After starting the game you see the main screen. It contains the following buttons:
	<ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 1em; margin: 0;">
		<li><img src="icons/Options.png" align="middle" style="margin-right: 1em"><a href="#option">Options</a></li>

	<H2 id="game">Game Description</H2>
	The game board is a matrix of hexes which can be occupied by troops of various colors. The number of troops in a cell is indicated by the size of a
	colored troop circle within that cell.
	<br clear="none" /> The troops are commanded by holding the mouse button pressed, move the mouse to the neighbor cell and release the button  (or touch the cell and
	move the finger in the 	direction you want to establish the movement vector). The
	command will be acknowledged by the appearance of a movement vector, and thereafter, in each update cycle, a certain proportion of the troops will be
	moved from the source cell to the destination cell until the source cell is exhausted. Movement vectors can be set in several directions at once, in
	which case the movement is divided evenly between the vector directions, and the command remains active until cancelled. The movement vector remains
	active even if the number of troops in that cell is zero. If the source cell is being captured by the enemy, all outgoing movement vectors will be removed.
	<br clear="none" /> The game is concurrent, so that commands are given continuously by all players without waiting for turns.

	<H2 id="single">Single Player</h2>
	Before starting a game, the basic game configuration must be set. The height and width of the board can be set. Higher settings result in
	smaller cells and maybe not usable on small screens. Also the number of computer players must be selected (the computer plays very stupid!). More options can be chosen with
	the <img src="icons/Options.png" align="middle" style="margin-left: 1em" alt="Options" width="16px" height="16px">-button.
	<br clear="none" />
	The gane starts after pressing the
	<img src="icons/Join.png" align="middle" style="margin-left: 1em" alt="Start" width="16px" height="16px">-button.
	Leave the screen by pressing the <img src="icons/Back.png" align="middle" style="margin-left: 1em" alt="Back" width="16px" height="16px">-button.

	<H2 id="multi">Multi Player</h2>
	<br clear="none" /> There are two different modes of multi-player game types: Playing with friends within the local network (WLAN, LAN) or with friends over
	the internet by google play.

	<div>A new game can be started by touching the  <img src="icons/New.png" align="middle" style="margin-left: 1em" alt="New" width="16px" height="16px">-button.
	Similar to the single player game, you have to choose the width, height and number of players. Press the
<img src="icons/Join.png" align="middle" style="margin-left: 1em" alt="Join" width="16px" height="16px">

	and the current number of players. Press the
	 <img src="icons/JoinActivate.png" align="middle" style="margin-left: 1em" alt="Join" width="16px" height="16px">-button to join the game.</div>
	<div>After all players have joined, the game will start after 3 seconds.</div>
	<H2 id="option">Options</h2>
	<div>In the options screen you can select multiple options for the next game These options will be stored after leaving the screen. To reset the options press the
